- name: Isometric Farming Process
  description: This assignment was to illustrate a process in an isometric style. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, isometric drawings use parallel lines. It is a functional type of illustration that can communicate a message that other styles cannot. I chose to illustrate the process of farming as it is a lifestyle I admire. Once I had a black and white version of my farm land, I created tonal families to colour in the artwork.

- name: Parking App Design
  description: Lot Locator helps you find a parking lot near any destination. No more driving in circles looking for a suitable parking lot, getting lost, or paying too much for parking. Following Androidâ€™s Material Design guidelines, I created a high fidelity prototype. Roboto is a wide, round typeface that is very clear on all devices. The languaue of headers and subheaders speaks directly to the user (using you rather than me or I.) Long chunks of text tend to be scanned over, so using short concise sentances ensures that your messages will be read and understood.

- name: Logo Redesign
  description: This logo includes an element to respresent both the hunting and fishing apsect of the supply store. The hunting is represented by the shape of a bear paw, while the fishing element has been represented by the fish barb of fishing hooks to cap the ends of the pad of the bear paw. I chose brown to tie in with the name Brown Bear Tackle Box, while the green letters compliment the brown and tie in the fishing theme.  Penumbra Sans Std Semibold is appropriate for this wordmark because it balances the visual weight of the logo.
